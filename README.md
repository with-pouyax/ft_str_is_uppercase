# ft_str_is_uppercase


Welcome to the `ft_str_is_uppercase` function repository. This utility function is designed to check if a string is composed entirely of uppercase letters, providing a straightforward solution for string validation and text processing tasks that require case sensitivity.

## Description

`ft_str_is_uppercase` evaluates a given string, pointed to by its argument, to determine if every character is an uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z'. It returns `1` (true) if the string meets these criteria, indicating it is entirely uppercase. If any character in the string is found to be outside the uppercase alphabetic range, the function returns `0` (false), indicating the string contains lowercase letters or non-alphabetic characters.
